Business::NoChex

A simple OO interface to the NoChex e-payment system.

The module allows easy verification of payments automatically on your
server via the NoCHex APC interface.

The NoChex server can be instructed to call a specific URI with a POST
operation whenever a payment is received on an account. This module 
provides a method for validating the data and utility mehtods for
accessing the values provided.

Templates suitable for Template::Toolkit are also provided and a test
script suitable for testing the operation and an example script of a typical 
barebones use are also included.
